# RTSP downmix
RTSP downmix: (4)in, (1)out. 2x2 grid. Labels outbound stream, records unlabeled local file. Bash.

## About
This script contains a command for `FFmpeg`, a popular open-source multimedia framework that allows users to encode, decode, transcode, and stream audio and video files.

The command takes four input video streams using RTSP protocol and applies a complex filter to combine them into a single output stream. The filter complex uses various scaling and overlay techniques to combine the input streams in a specific layout, with each stream labeled with text indicating its source. The output stream is then encoded using the `libx264` codec with certain parameters and is simultaneously written to an RTSP output stream and a `MPEG-TS` file on disk.

Here is a brief breakdown of the different components of the FFmpeg command:

The `-i` flag is used to specify the input streams.

The `-filter_complex` flag is used to specify the complex filtergraph that processes the input streams and produces the output stream.

The `-map` flag is used to specify which streams should be included in the output.

The `-c:v` flag is used to specify the video codec for encoding the output.

The `-crf` flag is used to specify the Constant Rate Factor for the output video, which controls the quality/file size tradeoff.

The `-preset` flag is used to specify the encoding speed preset, with `veryfast` being a faster preset that sacrifices some quality.

The `-tune` flag is used to specify a preset optimization for certain types of input streams, with `zerolatency` being optimized for low-latency streaming.

The `-f` flag is used to specify the output format and destination, with `[f=rtsp]rtsp://output_stream` specifying an RTSP output stream and `[f=mpegts]disk_file.ts` specifying a MPEG-TS file on disk.

The `-loglevel` and `-report` flags are used to specify the logging verbosity level and to generate a report file, respectively.

## Usage
To run this script, you will need to install `FFmpeg` if it is not already installed on your system. You can install FFmpeg by opening a terminal window and running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

This will install FFmpeg along with all of its dependencies on your system.

Once FFmpeg is installed, you can save the script to a file (for example, "script.sh") and then make it executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
Finally, you can run the script by typing its filename in the terminal and pressing Enter:

```bash
./script.sh
```

## Case specific configuration
Please note that you need to modify the script to match the specific RTSP input streams, output destinations, and font files that you are using. You can refer to the FFmpeg documentation for more information on the various options and settings available in the command.

## Applications
This script provides a flexible and powerful way to combine multiple video streams with custom text overlays and write the output to multiple destinations, making it suitable for a variety of applications, such as:

- Surveillance systems: This script can be used to merge multiple video streams from surveillance cameras into a single output stream that can be easily monitored and recorded.

- Live events: This script can be used to merge multiple video feeds from different cameras at a live event (e.g. sports, concerts) into a single output stream that can be broadcasted to a remote audience.

- Video conferencing: This script can be used to merge multiple video streams from different participants in a video conference into a single output stream that can be shared with other participants or recorded for later viewing.

- Broadcasting: This script can be used to merge multiple video feeds from different sources (e.g. studio cameras, remote cameras) into a single output stream that can be broadcasted to a wider audience.

- Video production: This script can be used during video production to monitor multiple camera angles at once and create a single output stream for editing and post-production.

## An additional consideration
In the script, the backslash `\` is used as an escape character to split long commands across multiple lines. When a backslash is used at the end of a line, it tells the shell to ignore the line break and treat the command as a single line.

This technique of using backslashes to split long commands across multiple lines is known as line continuation or line wrapping. It is often used to improve the readability and maintainability of complex shell scripts.

In the script, the backslashes are used to split the `-filter_complex` option into multiple lines for better readability. This option specifies the filtergraph that is used to process the input video streams and generate the output stream. The filtergraph consists of a series of filterchains, each of which contains one or more filter operations separated by semicolons.

By using backslashes to split the `-filter_complex` option into multiple lines, it is easier to understand the filtergraph and modify it if needed.
